# Dependency Update

Identifier: `dependency-update`

## Purpose

Change dependencies only with need, provenance, and rollback evidence.

## Common Lifecycle

- Primary Claude Code session confirms scope, constraints, exclusions, approvals, and specialist routing.
- Requirements and Planning defines acceptance evidence and routing.
- Implementation occurs only after required human approvals.
- Test and Quality records validation evidence and checks not run.
- Code Quality and Engineering Risk reviews remain independent from implementation.
- Documentation and Release Readiness returns a human decision packet and stops before release actions.

## Workflow-Specific Gates

- demonstrated need for the dependency change
- provenance, maintenance, license, and vulnerability signals
- transitive and lockfile impact
- compatibility validation
- rollback path to the previous dependency state

## Required Evidence

- scope and requirement traceability
- approvals needed or obtained
- validation performed and checks not run
- independent review findings
- unresolved limitations and human decisions

## Claude Code Routing

- The primary session remains Lead and may delegate once to a matching specialist.
- Specialists return evidence to the primary session and never delegate recursively.
- Workflow guidance is auxiliary and is not an executable command.
## Operational Notes

- Purpose / mission: This component supports the Software Development department responsibility described above and keeps that responsibility separate from planning, implementation, independent review, risk review, documentation, and release authority.
- When it is used: Use it only when the installed platform surface loads this file natively or when the Lead explicitly imports, invokes, or references it for a scoped software-development task.
- Inputs / expected context: Provide the target project objective, authorized paths, relevant source/test/resource directories, language, framework, package manager, commands, architecture constraints, API contracts, dependency policy, and acceptance criteria from the target repository.
- Outputs / completion evidence: Return concrete findings, plans, edits, validation results, review notes, limitations, and checks not run to the Lead; final completion requires evidence rather than assumption.
- Concrete example: Ask for a scoped API compatibility review, a bug-fix plan, an approved implementation step, or an independent code-quality review without secrets or external actions.
- Project-dependent elements: Repository layout, build/test/lint/type-check commands, generated-code areas, supported runtimes, CI/CD conventions, documentation paths, test strategy, and security/compliance requirements must be discovered from the target project.
- User- or organization-dependent elements: Account or plan availability, model/provider selection, permission mode, tools, connectors, MCP servers, credentials, private endpoints, reviewers, billing, telemetry, and deployment/release authority remain controlled outside this package.
- Fixed department constraints: Preserve responsibility boundaries, no self-review, no circular delegation, least privilege, human review for sensitive changes, no secret exposure, no automatic destructive/external/release action, and evidence-based completion.
- Limitations: Textual instructions cannot override platform permissions, managed policy, product availability, or human approval requirements.
