# Native Sources

Documentation review date: 2026-07-21.

Product surface: Gemini CLI persistent instruction files, GEMINI.md, commands, hooks, Skills, subagents, MCP, extension packaging, and trust controls.

Official source evidence checked or retained for this platform:

- https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
- https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/configuration.md

Validation method:

- Inventory of `gemini-cli/cybersecurity/` files and native support directories.
- Static syntax parsing for JSON, TOML, YAML where applicable.
- Reference resolution for retained repository-local prompts, Skills, agents, and config files where applicable.
- Removal of redundant area-level source copies after this platform-wide source file replaced them.

Current native facts recorded:

- Project paths: `gemini-cli/cybersecurity/<area>/` for all eight Cybersecurity areas.
- Discovery: use the platform-specific README and open/import from the documented working directory or manual UI location.
- Permissions: read-only/static by default; shell, network, MCP, connector, hosted tool, scanner, deployment, and production actions absent or denied unless a human explicitly configures them outside this baseline.
- Trust: repository-local configuration is effective only when the platform trusts or imports the project according to its current documentation.
- Precedence: nearest area-level instructions or manually selected area package govern the selected work; platform-level README and this file provide package-wide evidence.
- Omitted mechanisms: fake MCP servers, generated live hooks, external endpoints, credentials, cloud actions, scanners, and deployment automation are intentionally omitted.

Removed or deprecated field handling:

- Unsupported descriptive-only metadata is not treated as a permission control.
- Platform-specific frontmatter and config fields must be verified against current vendor documentation before use.
- For SDK packages, runtime API compatibility must be validated in an isolated environment without model calls before production use.
